*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, nu_00, E_45, nu_45, E_90, nu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8
    ##   thick  E_00 nu_00  E_45  nu_45  E_90 nu_90 alloy

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(thick, alloy),
    names_to = c( ".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
    
    # cols = everything()
  ) %>%
  filter(E > 0, nu > 0) %>%
   mutate(angle = as.integer(angle))
df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    nu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # ℹ 16 more rows

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
##
length(unique(df_stang_long$alloy))
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
length(unique(df_stang_long$angle))
```

    ## [1] 3

``` r
length(unique(df_stang_long$thick))
```

    ## [1] 4

**Observations**:

- ## Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?

- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - 1, find the length of unique alloy in dataset, shown in q2-task

- What angles were tested?
  - 3

- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 4

- (Write your own question here) -investigate if there is a relationship
  between E and nu

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
ggplot(df_stang_long, aes(x=E,y=nu))+
  geom_point(aes(color = alloy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color="red")+
  labs(tittle="E and nu", 
  x="young's modulus(E)",
  y="poisson's ratio(nu)")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
correlation <- cor(df_stang_long$E, df_stang_long$nu, use = "complete.obs")
correlation
```

    ## [1] 0.6677172

**Observations**:

- the correlation coefficient 0.667717 between young’s modulus and
  poisson’s ratio indicated a positive relationship between these two
  property for this alloy al_24st. which means as young’s modulus
  increases, poisson’s ratio tends to increase. however it is not very
  strong correlation. furthermore the plot shows the dataset being very
  spread out and far from the regression line, with a wide confidence
  interval, which further suggest that the association between E and nu
  is not strong.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

> “A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
> of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
> amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - the graph is plotting E against nu, with the color representing
    thickness. the plot shows a distinct cluster of larger thickness
    0.081 at the bottom left while smallest thickness E\>10500,occupying
    the top part of the graph. The distinct cluster of 0.081 seems to
    suggest E and nu depend on the thickness of the material. The plot
    also show some relationship between the thickness and E property,
    where smaller thickness shows Higher.
- Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another?
  - to a large extend it is not conclusive.Though the graph shows a
    possible relationship between thickness, E and nu, the lack of
    distinct differences across the thickness and the property and lack
    of number of data points makes the evidence not necessary
    conclusive. The similarity between thick 0.064 and thick 0.032 and
    lack of distinct cluster also makes it less conclusive ( this maybe
    due to the critical point of change of elasticity being between
    0.081 to 0.064 ).
