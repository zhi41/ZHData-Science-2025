*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

``` r
df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- (Class, Sex, Age, Survived, n ) class:class of the person
  “1st”,“2nd”,“3rd” and “crew” Sex: Male and female Age: Child and
  adult, not numbers. Survived: whether the person survived the Titanic
  or not n:number of people who falls into same Class, Sex, Age,
  Survived.

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - the wiki stated that there are estimated 2224 people on the titanic
    with approximately 1500 death while df_titanic shows a total of 2201
    passengers
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - Historical records may have inconsistencies due to lost or
    incomplete documentation. the incident happened in 1912 and the
    documentation may not be properly preserved
  - The different sources used for the data may have cause the
    difference in data eg new findings over the years,
  - the wiki and df_titanic may have different classification for the
    number of people on the titanic, for wiki is passengers and crew
    while df_titanic is 1st,2nd,3rd and crew.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_survived<-df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes")


ggplot(df_survived, aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex))+ 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of people survived", x = "Class", y = "number of people")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#for presentation

ggplot(df_titanic, aes(x = Class, y = n, fill= Age))+ 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total number of people on board base on Age", x = "class", y = "number of people")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-2.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- females have a higher survival rate across the 3 classes which maybe a
  result from the priority for woman and children passengers evacuation
  first.
- the survival rate of male in second class is the lowest followed by
  1st then 3rd
- First class passengers have the highest survival rate out of the 3
  class which may be due to the position of the rooms inhibit by the
  class which can greatly reduce the speed of the evacuation.
- the Crew have the highest number of male surviving and overwhelming
  more than the female crews which may be due to the gender disparity in
  the number of males and females in the crew, having much more males
  than females.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # ℹ 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

df_survived<-df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") 

ggplot(df_survived, aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex))+ 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - (Your response here)

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

df_survived<-df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes")


ggplot(df_survived, aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex))+ 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(~Age)+
  labs(title = "Proportion of people who survived in each class", x = "Class", y = "proportion of survival")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- (Write your observations here.)
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - (Your response here)

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
