*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you’ll complete a large number of
*exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content
with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you
think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start
out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring,
documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these
skills again and again in each challenge.

*Note*: You will have seen all of these steps in `e-vis00-basics`. This
challenge is *primarily* a practice run of the submission system. The
Data Exploration part should be very simple.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and
supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit
a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without
all files uploaded to GitHub.**

# Data Exploration

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and
document your observations.

### **q1** Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

``` r
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below
## Your code here!
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](c00-diamonds-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

The scatterplot shows that price tends to rise with carat weight, but
the relationship is not strictly due to weight as there are substantial
overlap in prices.There maybe factors such as cut, color, and clarity to
be included to explain price fully.

Price seems generally increases faster than linearly with carat.

### **q2** Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

``` r
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat, price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](c00-diamonds-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**: The scatterplot shows that price tends to rise with
carat weight the cut helps with explaining the variation in price
according to the cut, ideal tend towards being more expensive and fair
tend towards being less expensive

# Communication

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to
GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data
Science
Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

### **q3** *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the “Knit” button at the top of your
document in RStudio.

<figure>
<img src="./images/c00-knit.png" alt="Terminal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Terminal</figcaption>
</figure>

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open
a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

### **q4** *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

<figure>
<img src="./images/c00-unstaged.png" alt="Terminal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Terminal</figcaption>
</figure>

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files`
folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to
include all the files under that directory.

### **q5** *Submit* your work to Canvas

Navigate to your GitHub repository’s website and find the URL that
corresponds to your report. Submit this to Canvas to complete the
assignment.

### **q6** *Prepare* to present your team’s findings!

If your team is on-deck, you are responsible for putting together a
discussion of the challenge. I’ll demonstrate how to do this by leading
the discussion of Challenge 0.
