*Purpose*: We’ve been learning how to quantify uncertainty in estimates
through the exercises; now its time to put those skills to use studying
real data. In this challenge we’ll use concepts like confidence
intervals to help us make sense of census data.

Error](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2020/calculating-margins-of-error-acs.html)

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

You might wonder why the `Margin of Error` in the population estimates
is listed as `*****`. From the [documentation (PDF
link)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj81Omy16TrAhXsguAKHTzKDQEQFjABegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Facs%2Ftech_docs%2Faccuracy%2FMultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf%3F&usg=AOvVaw2TOrVuBDlkDI2gde6ugce_)
for the ACS:

> If the margin of error is displayed as ‘\*\*\*\*\*’ (five asterisks),
> the estimate has been controlled to be equal to a fixed value and so
> it has no sampling error. A standard error of zero should be used for
> these controlled estimates when completing calculations, such as those
> in the following section.

This means that for cases listed as `*****` the US Census Bureau
recommends treating the margin of error (and thus standard error) as
zero.

### **q2** Obtain median income data from the Census Bureau:

- `Filter > Topics > Income and Poverty > Income and Poverty`
- `Filter > Geography > County > All counties in United States`
- Look for `Median Income in the Past 12 Months` (Table S1903)
- Download the 2018 5-year ACS estimates; save to your `data` folder and
  add the filename below.

``` r
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table S1903
filename_income <- "./data/ACSST5Y2018.S1903-Data.csv"

## NOTE: No need to edit

Use the following test to check that you downloaded the correct file:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use to check you got the right file.
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_income %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001") %>%
    pull(`Estimate!!Percent Distribution!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!2-person families`)
  == 45.6
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Well done!")
```

    ## [1] "Well done!"

This dataset is in desperate need of some *tidying*. To simplify the
task, we’ll start by considering the `\\d-person families` columns
first.

### **q3** Tidy the `df_income` dataset by completing the code below. Pivot and rename the columns to arrive at the column names `id, geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate, income_moe`.

*Hint*: You can do this in a single pivot using the `".value"` argument
and a `names_pattern` using capture groups `"()"`. Remember that you can
use an OR operator `|` in a regex to allow for multiple possibilities in
a capture group, for example `"(Estimate|Margin of Error)"`.

``` r
df_q3 <-
  df_income %>%
  select(
    Geography,
    contains("Geographic"),
    # This will select only the numeric d-person family columns;
    # it will ignore the annotation columns
    contains("median") & matches("\\d-person families") & !contains("Annotation of")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), as.numeric)) %>%
# TODO: Pivot the data, rename the columns
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(Geography, `Geographic Area Name`),
    names_to = c(".value", "category"),
    names_pattern = "^(Estimate|Margin of Error)!!Median income \\(dollars\\)(?: MOE)?!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!(.+)$"
  ) %>%
  rename(
    geographic_area_name = `Geographic Area Name`,
    income_estimate = Estimate,
    income_moe = `Margin of Error`
  ) %>%
  glimpse()
```

    ## Warning: There were 8 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `across(contains("median"), as.numeric)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 7 remaining warnings.

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q3),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_q3 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_moe)
  == 6663
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

The data gives finite values for the Margin of Error, which is closely
related to the Standard Error. The Census Bureau documentation gives the
following relationship between Margin of Error and Standard Error:

$$\text{MOE} = 1.645 \times \text{SE}.$$

### **q4** Convert the margin of error to standard error. Additionally, compute a 99% confidence interval on income, and normalize the standard error to `income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate`. Provide these columns with the names `income_SE, income_lo, income_hi, income_CV`.

``` r
df_q4 <- df_q3 %>%
  mutate(
    income_SE = income_moe / 1.645,
    #for 99% 2.576 
    income_lo = income_estimate - 2.576*income_SE,
    income_hi = income_estimate + 2.576*income_SE,
    income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate
  )
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q4),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe",
    "income_SE", "income_lo", "income_hi", "income_CV")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_SE) - 4050.456
  ) / 4050.456 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_lo) - 54513.72
  ) / 54513.72 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_hi) - 75380.28
  ) / 75380.28 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_CV) - 0.06236556
  ) / 0.06236556 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

One last wrangling step: We need to join the two datasets so we can
compare population with income.

### **q5** Join `df_q4` and `df_pop`.

``` r
## TODO: Join df_q4 and df_pop by the appropriate column

# df_data <- df_q4 %>%
#   left_join(df_pop, by = "Geography")
# names(df_pop)
df_data <- df_q4 %>%
  left_join(
    df_pop %>%
      select(Geography, population = population_estimate),
    by = "Geography"
  )
```

# Analysis

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We now have both estimates and confidence intervals for
`\\d-person families`. Now we can compare cases with quantified
uncertainties: Let’s practice!

### **q6** Study the following graph, making sure to note what you can *and can’t* conclude based on the estimates and confidence intervals. Document your observations below and answer the questions.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
wid <- 0.5

df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! `fct_reorder()` removing 2 missing values.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = TRUE` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = FALSE` to preserve NAs.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q6-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Document your observations here.
  - Overall range: Median household incomes vary considerably across
    counties and family sizes, from roughly 50,000 up to over 200,000.
  - Many of the confidence intervals for different family sizes within
    the same county overlap
  - some countries have noticeable wider confidence intervals(eg. dukes,
    Nantucket) showing lesser certainty which maybe due to smaller
    sample size -some countries have noticeable shorter confidence
    intervals(eg. suffolk, hampden,middlesex..) showing higher certainty
    and better estimate
- Can you confidently distinguish between household incomes in Suffolk
  county? Why or why not?
  - It is rather difficult to confidently distinguish the median incomes
    for different family sizes in Suffolk county, as their confidence
    intervals overlap and their true median incomes maybe be quite close
    thus it is quite difficult to confidently distinguish them despite
    their rather narrow confidence intervals which suggest higher
    precision in estimation. but just from the graph can roughly
    estimate 6\>5\>4\>3\>2.
- Which counties have the widest confidence intervals?
  - Nantucket

In the next task you’ll investigate the relationship between population
and uncertainty.

### **q7** Plot the standard error against population for all counties. Create a visual that effectively highlights the trends in the data. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint*: Remember that standard error is a function of *both* variability
(e.g. variance) and sample size.

``` r
ggplot(df_data, aes(x = population, y = income_SE, color = category)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Standard Error vs. Population",
    x = "Population",
    y = "Standard Error",
    color = "Family Size"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 814 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q7-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- What *overall* trend do you see between `SE` and population? Why might
  this trend exist?
  - As the population increases the standard error decreases.Larger
    populations generally provide more data and sample size, which
    reduces uncertainty in the estimate.Furthermore the standard error
    is inversely related to sample size.
- What does this *overall* trend tell you about the relative ease of
  studying small vs large counties?
  - Larger counties yield more precise estimates and lower Se, making
    conclusions and observation more reliable. -it increases the
    difficulty in studies that involve small counties, as the estimate
    may tend to have higher standard error and less precise which may
    result in the conclusion being less reliable or comparison made can
    be erroneous due to the sampling noise

Now it’s your turn! You have income data for every county in the United
States: Pose your own question and try to answer it with the data.

### **q8** Pose your own question about the data. Create a visualization (or table) here, and document your observations.

``` r
## TODO: Pose and answer your own question about the data


df_q8 <- 
  df_income %>%
  select(
    Geography,
    contains("Geographic"),
    # This will select only the numeric d-person family columns;
    # it will ignore the annotation columns
    contains("median") & matches("FAMILIES!!Families!!(Married-couple families|Female householder, no husband present)$") & !contains("Annotation of")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), as.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(Geography,`Geographic Area Name`),
    names_to = c(".value", "category"),
    names_pattern = "^(Estimate|Margin of Error)!!Median income \\(dollars\\)(?: MOE)?!!FAMILIES!!Families!!(.+)$"
  ) %>%
  rename(
    geographic_area_name =`Geographic Area Name`,
    income_estimate =Estimate,
    income_moe =`Margin of Error`
  )%>%
  glimpse()
```

    ## 2 Married-couple families                       71455

**Observations**:

- Document your observations here

-Married-couple families have significantly higher median incomes than
female householder, no husband present families. The IQR’s median is
much higher for married-couple families,around 71455 while no husband
present is 30276. this maybe due to the married-couple have income
coming from two breadwinner while female householder, no husband present
may have higher chance of sole breadwinner. There may be other reasons
such as income gender gap or constraints regarding employment due to
caring children as sole parent.

There is more variability in income for married-couple families, which
may be because their income can come from two breadwinners, whereas
female householder, no husband present have higher chance of sole
income. married-couple families may have lesser constraints when it
comes to employment and have wider opportunities of jobs which may
induce more variability

Ideas:

- Compare trends across counties that are relevant to you; e.g. places
  you’ve lived, places you’ve been, places in the US that are
  interesting to you.
- In q3 we tidied the median `\\d-person families` columns only.
  - Tidy the other median columns to learn about other people groups.
  - Tidy the percentage columns to learn about how many households of
    each category are in each county.
- Your own idea!
