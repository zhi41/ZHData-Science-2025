*Purpose*: In this last challenge we’ll focus on using logistic
regression to study a large, complicated dataset. Interpreting the
results of a model can be challenging—both in terms of the statistics
and the real-world reasoning—so we’ll get some practice in this
challenge.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and
supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit
a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without
all files uploaded to GitHub.**

*Background*: We’ll study data from the [Stanford Open Policing
Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), specifically their
dataset on Massachusetts State Patrol police stops.

# Setup

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Go to the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) page and download the Massachusetts State Police records in `Rds` format. Move the data to your `data` folder and match the `filename` to load the data.

*Note*: An `Rds` file is an R-specific file format. The function
`readRDS` will read these files.

``` r
## TODO: Download the data, move to your data folder, and load it
filename <- "./data/yg821jf8611_ma_statewide_2020_04_01.rds"
df_data <- readRDS(filename)
```

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q2** Do your “first checks” on the dataset. What are the basic facts about this dataset?

``` r
dim(df_data)
```

**Observations**:

- What are the basic facts about this dataset? Dimensions – Rows:
  3,416,238 individual stops – Columns: 24 types

Date range – Min(date): 2007-01-01 – Max(date): 2015-12-31 – (1st
quartile: 2009-04-22; median: 2011-07-08; mean: 2011-07-16; 3rd
quartile: 2013-08-27)

Stop type – All 3,416,238 rows are vehicular stops.

Overall “outcome” (citation/warning/arrest):, warning :1146078,
citation:2171283,arrest : 92019 ,summons:0, 6,858 NAs

Note that we have both a `subject_race` and `race_Raw` column. There are
a few possibilities as to what `race_Raw` represents:

- `race_Raw` could be the race of the police officer in the stop
- `race_Raw` could be an unprocessed version of `subject_race`

Let’s try to distinguish between these two possibilities.

### **q3** Check the set of factor levels for `subject_race` and `raw_Race`. What do you note about overlap / difference between the two sets?

``` r
## TODO: Determine the factor levels for subject_race and raw_Race

subject_levels <- levels(df_data$subject_race)
raw_levels     <- sort(unique(df_data$raw_Race))

subject_levels

**Observations**:

- What are the unique values for `subject_race`? “asian/pacific
  islander” “black”, “hispanic”, “white”, “other”, “unknown”  
- What are the unique values for `raw_Race`? “A”, “American Indian or
  Alaskan Native”, “Asian or Pacific Islander”, “Black”, “Hispanic”,
  “Middle Eastern or East Indian (South Asian)”, “None - for no operator
  present citations only” “White”
- What is the overlap between the two sets? “asian/pacific islander”
  “black”, “hispanic”, “white”, “other”, “unknown
- What is the difference between the two sets? “A”, “American Indian or
  Alaskan Native”, “Asian or Pacific Islander”, “Black”, “Hispanic”,
  “Middle Eastern or East Indian (South Asian)”, “None - for no operator
  present citations only” “White”

### **q4** Check whether `subject_race` and `raw_Race` match for a large fraction of cases. Which of the two hypotheses above is most likely, based on your results?

*Note*: Just to be clear, I’m *not* asking you to do a *statistical*
hypothesis test.

``` r
## TODO: Devise your own way to test the hypothesis posed above.


df_match <- df_data %>%
  mutate(
    raw_to_subject = case_when(
      raw_Race == "Asian or Pacific Islander" ~ "asian/pacific islander",
      raw_Race == "Black" ~ "black",
      raw_Race == "Hispanic" ~ "hispanic",
      raw_Race == "White" ~ "white",
      raw_Race %in% c("American Indian or Alaskan Native", "Middle Eastern or East Indian (South Asian)", "None - for no operator present citations only") ~ "other",
      TRUE ~ "unknown")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(subject_race), !is.na(raw_to_subject)) %>%
  mutate(match = (subject_race == raw_to_subject))


agree_rate <- mean(df_match$match)
agree_rate
```

    ## [1] 0.9761115

**Observations**

Between the two hypotheses:

- `race_Raw` could be the race of the police officer in the stop
- `race_Raw` could be an unprocessed version of `subject_race`

which is most plausible, based on your results?

- since the agreement of the records have same races of 0.976115,
  race_raw is most likely just unprocessed version of `subject_race`,
  where raw_Race is just the original, unstandardized text of the
  driver’s race which is later lowercased and grouped into subject_race
  factor.

## Vis

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q5** Compare the *arrest rate*—the fraction of total cases in which the subject was arrested—across different factors. Create as many visuals (or tables) as you need, but make sure to check the trends across all of the `subject` variables. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

(Note: Create as many chunks and visuals as you need)

``` r
# age
df_age <- df_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(subject_age)) %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(subject_age, breaks=seq(10,95,by=5), right=FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    arrest_rate = mean(arrest_made, na.rm=TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(df_age, aes(age_group, arrest_rate)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x="Age group", y="Arrest rate")

**Observations**:

- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_age`?
  - arrest rate increases from age 10 to 25
  - arrest rate fo age group25 to 30 is the highest
  - the arrest rate decreases as the age group increase from 30 to 90
  - age group 85~90 have to lowest arrest rate
  - the arrest rate jumps slightly between age group 85~90 and 90~95
- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_sex`?
  - females have a lower arrest rate than males
- How does `arrest_rate` tend to vary with `subject_race`?
  - hispanic has the highest arrest rate, followed by black, others
    white, asian/pacific islanders then unknown

# Modeling

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

We’re going to use a model to study the relationship between `subject`
factors and arrest rate, but first we need to understand a bit more
about *dummy variables*

### **q6** Run the following code and interpret the regression coefficients. Answer the the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; inspect the estimated model terms.
fit_q6 <-
  glm(
    formula = arrest_made ~ subject_age + subject_race + subject_sex,
    data = df_data %>%
      filter(
        !is.na(arrest_made),
        subject_race %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic")
      ),
    family = "binomial"
  )

fit_q6 %>% tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 5
    ##   term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)           -2.67    0.0132      -202.  0        
    ## 2 subject_age           -0.0142  0.000280     -50.5 0        
    ## 3 subject_racehispanic   0.513   0.0119        43.3 0        
    ## 4 subject_racewhite     -0.380   0.0103       -37.0 3.12e-299
    ## 5 subject_sexfemale     -0.755   0.00910      -83.0 0

**Observations**:

- Which `subject_race` levels are included in fitting the model?
  - “white”, “black”, “hispanic”
- Which `subject_race` levels have terms in the model?
  - black is used as the implicit reference level, and
    dummy‐coefficients are hispanic and white

You should find that each factor in the model has a level *missing* in
its set of terms. This is because R represents factors against a
*reference level*: The model treats one factor level as “default”, and
each factor model term represents a change from that “default” behavior.
For instance, the model above treats `subject_sex==male` as the
reference level, so the `subject_sexfemale` term represents the *change
in probability* of arrest due to a person being female (rather than
male).

The this reference level approach to coding factors is necessary for
[technical
reasons](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/94842/lectures/lecture10/lecture10-94842.html#why-is-one-of-the-levels-missing-in-the-regression),
but it complicates interpreting the model results. For instance; if we
want to compare two levels, neither of which are the reference level, we
have to consider the difference in their model coefficients. But if we
want to compare all levels against one “baseline” level, then we can
relevel the data to facilitate this comparison.

By default `glm` uses the first factor level present as the reference
level. Therefore we can use
`mutate(factor = fct_relevel(factor, "desired_level"))` to set our
`"desired_level"` as the reference factor.

### **q7** Re-fit the logistic regression from q6 setting `"white"` as the reference level for `subject_race`. Interpret the the model terms and answer the questions below.

``` r
## TODO: Re-fit the logistic regression, but set "white" as the reference
## level for subject_race

fit_q7 <-
  glm(
    arrest_made ~ subject_age + subject_race + subject_sex,
    data = df_data %>%
      filter(!is.na(arrest_made),
             subject_race %in% c("white","black","hispanic")) %>%
      mutate(subject_race = fct_relevel(subject_race, "white")),
    family = "binomial"
  )

fit_q7 %>% tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 5
    ##   term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)           -3.05    0.0109      -279.  0        
    ## 2 subject_age           -0.0142  0.000280     -50.5 0        
    ## 3 subject_raceblack      0.380   0.0103        37.0 3.12e-299
    ## 4 subject_racehispanic   0.893   0.00859      104.  0        
    ## 5 subject_sexfemale     -0.755   0.00910      -83.0 0

**Observations**:

- Which `subject_race` level has the highest probability of being
  arrested, according to this model? Which has the lowest probability?
  - hispanic has the highest probability of 0.89264703 and white has the
    lowest porbability
- What could explain this difference in probabilities of arrest across
  race? List **multiple** possibilities.
  - Higher targeted searches for certain races can lead to more arrests.
    – Patrol patterns priorities may vary by county or town, and these
    areas may have different racial makeups. – Vehicle type, time-of-day
    could influence both stop severity and arrest decisions. – Even
    after accounting for age and sex, unconscious or conscious bias in
    decision‐making could drive different outcomesbased on race
- Look at the set of variables in the dataset; do any of the columns
  relate to a potential explanation you listed?
  - ‘reason_for_stop’: lets you check if stop types differs by race.
  - ‘search_conducted’ and ‘search_basis’: show whether some races are
    searched—and on what grounds—more frequently.
  - ‘county_name and location’: check for geographic variation in
    enforcement.
  - ‘vehicle_type’, ‘citation_issued’, and ‘warning_issued’ capture
    downstream outcomes that could mediate from stop to arrest.

One way we can explain differential arrest rates is to include some
measure indicating the presence of an arrestable offense. We’ll do this
in a particular way in the next task.

### **q8** Re-fit the model using a factor indicating the presence of contraband in the subject’s vehicle. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## TODO: Repeat the modeling above, but control for whether contraband was found
## during the police stop

df_q8 <- df_data %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(arrest_made),
    subject_race %in% c("white","black","hispanic")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    subject_race = fct_relevel(subject_race, "white"),
    contraband_found = if_else(is.na(contraband_found), FALSE, contraband_found)
  )

fit_q8 <- glm(
  arrest_made ~ subject_age + subject_race + subject_sex + contraband_found,
  data = df_q8,
  family = "binomial"
)

fit_q8 %>% tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 5
    ##   term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)           -3.31    0.0113      -293.  0        
    ## 2 subject_age           -0.0101  0.000284     -35.4 1.34e-274
    ## 3 subject_raceblack      0.351   0.0105        33.3 1.14e-242
    ## 4 subject_racehispanic   0.880   0.00885       99.5 0        
    ## 5 subject_sexfemale     -0.694   0.00921      -75.4 0        
    ## 6 contraband_foundTRUE   3.02    0.0135       223.  0

**Observations**:

- How does controlling for found contraband affect the `subject_race`
  terms in the model?
  - Black vs. White falls from about +0.3797288 log-odds down to
    +0.350568
  - Hispanic vs. White falls from about +0.892647 down to +0.87987
  - A high positive coefficient 3.022196 means stops where contraband is
    found are orders of magnitude more likely to end in arrest than
    stops without any contraband
- What does the *finding of contraband* tell us about the stop? What
  does it *not* tell us about the stop?
  - Why a search was conducted in the first place and how many stops
    weren’t searched
  - Non-contraband grounds for arrest
  - Upstream bias in search intensity—if some groups are searched more
    frequently, you’ll find more contraband among them even if true
    rates are equal.

### **q9** Go deeper: Pose at least one more question about the data and fit at least one more model in support of answering that question.

**Observations**:

``` r
df_search <- df_data %>%
  filter(search_conducted == TRUE, !is.na(contraband_found),
         subject_race %in% c("white","black","hispanic")) %>%
  mutate(subject_race = fct_relevel(subject_race, "white"))


fit_q9 <- glm(
  contraband_found ~ subject_race + subject_age + subject_sex,
  data   = df_search,
  family = "binomial"
)


fit_q9 %>% tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 5
    ##   term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)            0.939   0.0288       32.6  8.81e-234
    ## 2 subject_raceblack     -0.191   0.0248       -7.69 1.44e- 14
    ## 3 subject_racehispanic  -0.360   0.0225      -16.0  1.29e- 57
    ## 4 subject_age           -0.0258  0.000837    -30.9  3.50e-209
    ## 5 subject_sexfemale     -0.266   0.0231      -11.5  1.07e- 30

Where search was conducted, do contraband “hit rates” differ by subject
race once we control for age and sex? - Document your question and
findings - White drivers, since rest negative estimate, have the highest
contraband-found rates. - Black drivers see a −0.19 estimate of finding
contraband compared to whites  
- Hispanic drivers see a −0.36 drop in log-odds compared to whites. -
Each extra year of age reduces the log-odds by 0.0258, means as age
increases less likely to find contrabands. - Female drivers have a
−0.266 log-odds of contraband compared to males. - The of Black and
especially Hispanic drivers yield contraband less often than searches of
white drivers - there maybe a pattern of data show minority drivers get
searched without as strong evidence, so police cast a wider net that
snags fewer contraband finds per search

-however this only looks after a search occurs and it doesn’t explain
why officers chose to search in the first place
